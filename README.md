 ## Title : Mall Customers Segmentation into multiple groups 
 
 ## Data : 
 Data has been taken from kaggle dataset Mall Customer Segmentation Data, corresponding csv file is present in Data folder of this repo. Link to download data: https://www.kaggle.com/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python/download
 
 ## Overview :
 The purpose of this project is to cluster customers in a mall into multiple groups on the basis of age, spending capability, spending score etc. This can provide us useful insights into what are the requiremetns of each group and accordingly marketing strategies and policies can be built to optimize spending score of the customers. 
 
## Clustering Algorithms Implemented

K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that is used to solve the clustering problems in machine learning or data science. In this topic, we will learn what is K-means clustering algorithm, how the algorithm works, along with the Python implementation of k-means clustering.
Agglomerative Hierarchial is used for generating clusters, optimal number of clusters is obtained using Dendogram method.

DBSCAN stands for density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise. It is able to find arbitrary shaped clusters and clusters with noise (i.e. outliers). The main idea behind DBSCAN is that a point belongs to a cluster if it is close to many points from that cluster.

 
 ## Summary 
 
 
 Executed Data Visualization (Histogram, Pie Chart, Box Plot) to get an understanding on the input features
 
 Applied KMeans, Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering and DBSCAN algorithm to cluster the data points
 
 Performed Elbow Technique , Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin techniques to find number of clusters.
 
 # conclusion
 
 By looking at the clusters of customers and their corresponding spending scores, customers have been aggregated them into 4 different categories namely Usual Customers, Priority Customers, Senior Citizen Target Customers, Young Target Customers. Appropriate marketing strategies and policies (according to segment in which custome lies) can be made to optimize the spending scores of the customer in the Mall.
