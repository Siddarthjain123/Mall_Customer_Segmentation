# Mall_Customer_Segmentation
The purpose of this project is to cluster customers in a mall into multiple groups on the basis of age, spending capability, spending score etc. This can provide us useful insights into what are the requiremetns of each group and accordingly marketing strategies and policies can be built to optimize spending score of the customers. <br />
Executed Data Visualization (Histogram, Pie Chart, Box Plot) to get an understanding on the input features.<br />
Applied KMeans, Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering and DBSCAN algorithm to cluster the data points.<br />
